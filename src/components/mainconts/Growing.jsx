                        I became interested in technology stacks for Mern-Stack web development that I had not encountered during my undergraduate days, and after graduation, I went to private academies to study while making projects with my academy classmates.

                        The Mern-Stack development job is to develop everything the customer sees. In other words, it is the first thing customers see, so I think it's about making a first impression. I find this kind of work very attractive and I want to be a key member who can contribute to a development team that sees and reflects customer reactions immediately.
